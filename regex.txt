nginx regular expression
rewrite "^/v/sv([0-9]{0,5})((/index(|_(\d{1,2}))\.html)|/)?$" /acg/?id=$1&part=$5 last;

niconico - everything after sm number is allowed but ignored..
bilibili - av######/{blah}index_2.html will work
acfun is okay
tucao use js for parts
moemoe don't support it
danmaku uses php query string
